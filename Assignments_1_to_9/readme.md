# 🐍 Assignment 3 - Python Projects

Welcome to **Assignment 3**, a collection of exciting Python-based projects designed to improve your programming logic, build real-world applications, and explore the basics of web app development with Streamlit.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository includes both console-based games and utility scripts along with interactive web apps. These projects help in understanding:

- 🧠 Core Python syntax and logic
- 🔁 Loops and conditional statements
- 🎲 Randomization and user input
- 🖥️ String and time manipulation
- 🌐 Streamlit for web app creation

## 🗂️ Project List

### 1️⃣ Mad Libs Game ✍️  
A word substitution game that forms funny stories using user inputs.  
**Concepts:** User input, string concatenation

---

### 2️⃣ Guess the Number (Computer) 🔢  
The computer selects a number, and the user guesses it.  
**Concepts:** Random number generation, loops, conditionals

---

### 3️⃣ Guess the Number (User) 🧠  
The user thinks of a number, and the computer guesses it using binary search logic.  
**Concepts:** Logic building, binary search, while loops

---

### 4️⃣ Rock, Paper, Scissors ✊🖐️✌️  
Classic game between user and computer.  
**Concepts:** Random module, if-else statements

---

### 5️⃣ Hangman Game 🪢  
A word-guessing game where incorrect guesses lead to a 'hanging'.  
**Concepts:** Lists, loops, string manipulation

---

### 6️⃣ Countdown Timer ⏳  
A countdown that runs from user input time to zero.  
**Concepts:** `time.sleep()`, loops, input validation

---

### 7️⃣ Password Generator 🔐  
Generates strong passwords based on length and complexity.  
**Concepts:** `random`, `string`, secure password creation

---

### 8️⃣ BMI Calculator (Streamlit App) ⚖️  
A web-based app that calculates Body Mass Index using user input.  
**Concepts:** Streamlit UI, input/output interface

---

### 9️⃣ Build a Website with Streamlit 🌐  
An interactive and customizable web app built using Streamlit.  
**Concepts:** Web UI components, layout, interactivity

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🐍 **Python 3.x**
- 🌐 **Streamlit**
- 📦 Built-in modules: `random`, `time`, `string`
